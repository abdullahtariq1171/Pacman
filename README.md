# Pacman
Pacman is my first ever coding project which i coded in my ITC (Intro to Computing) course at FAST. I also received a prize for this project from my professor, [Dr.Mehreen Saeed](http://www.nu.edu.pk/campus/Employee/Mehreen-Saeed_3796). It is developed in C++ using gcc.

## PS pardon me for code quality length wise, it was my first project. And i don't want to change it, just to keep my memory.

## I am still very proud of it.

You can ignore  makearrayfile , it was just for testing something.
